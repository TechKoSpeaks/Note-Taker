## User Story

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes
<br />
I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before
<br />
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
<br />
<br />

## Guidelines:

Utilizing GET /notes - will return the notes.html file.

GET * - will return the index.html file

The application also has a db.json file on the backend that is utilized to store and retrieve notes using the fs module.

The following API routes should be created:

GET /api/notes - Should read the db.json file and return all saved notes as JSON.

POST /api/notes - Should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the db.json file, and then return the new note to the client.


DELETE /api/notes/:id - Should receive a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete. This means you'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved. In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the db.json file, remove the note with the given id property, and then rewrite the notes to the db.json file.
